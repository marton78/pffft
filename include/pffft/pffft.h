/*
   PFFFT : a Pretty Fast FFT.

   This is basically an adaptation of the single precision fftpack
   (v4) as found on netlib taking advantage of SIMD instruction found
   on cpus such as intel x86 (SSE1), powerpc (Altivec), and arm (NEON).
   
   For architectures where no SIMD instruction is available, the code
   falls back to a scalar version.  

   Restrictions: 

   - 1D transforms only, with 32-bit single precision.

   - supports only transforms for inputs of length N of the form
   N=(2^a)*(3^b)*(5^c), a >= 5, b >=0, c >= 0 (32, 48, 64, 96, 128,
   144, 160, etc are all acceptable lengths). Performance is best for
   128<=N<=8192.

   - all (float*) pointers in the functions below are expected to
   have an "simd-compatible" alignment, that is 16 bytes on x86 and
   powerpc CPUs.
  
   You can allocate such buffers with the functions
   pffft_aligned_malloc / pffft_aligned_free (or with stuff like
   posix_memalign..)

     Perform a Fourier transform , The z-domain data is stored in the
     most efficient order for transforming it back, or using it for
     convolution. If you need to have its content sorted in the
     "usual" way, that is as an array of interleaved complex numbers,
     either use pffft_transform_ordered , or call pffft_zreorder after
     the forward fft, and before the backward fft.

     Transforms are not scaled: PFFFT_BACKWARD(PFFFT_FORWARD(x)) = N*x.
     Typically you will want to scale the backward transform by 1/N.

     The 'work' pointer should point to an area of N (2*N for complex
     fft) floats, properly aligned. If 'work' is NULL, then stack will
     be used instead (this is probably the best strategy for small
     FFTs, say for N < 16384). Threads usually have a small stack, that
     there's no sufficient amount of memory, usually leading to a crash!
     Use the heap with pffft_aligned_malloc() in this case.

     For a real forward transform (PFFFT_REAL | PFFFT_FORWARD) with real
     input with input(=transformation) length N, the output array is
     'mostly' complex:
       index k in 1 .. N/2 -1  corresponds to frequency k * Samplerate / N
       index k == 0 is a special case:
         the real() part contains the result for the DC frequency 0,
         the imag() part contains the result for the Nyquist frequency Samplerate/2
     both 0-frequency and half frequency components, which are real,
     are assembled in the first entry as  F(0)+i*F(N/2).
     With the output size N/2 complex values (=N real/imag values), it is
     obvious, that the result for negative frequencies are not output,
     cause of symmetry.
